###Retrieve a user as a non-administrator

While user accounts can only be modified by administrators, any user on the domain can read user profiles. A non-admin user can make a users.get or users.list request with the viewType parameter equal to domain_public to retrieve a user's public profile. This permits a non-admin user to access a standard set of core fields. For a custom field, you can choose whether it should be public or private when defining the schema.
    Note: Any profiles with contact sharing disabled will not be shown to non-admin users.
